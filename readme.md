# Magic Garden AHK Macros (Discord applet)

AutoHotkey v2 scripts to automate the two-plot garden mini-game inside Discord. Hotkeys: Shift+S (start), Shift+P (pause/resume), Shift+C (calibrate crash recovery), Ctrl+Esc (abort). Scripts assume you begin at the top tile of the walkway between the two 10x10 plots. Inputs prefer SendEvent with scancodes and held keys to register reliably in the applet.

```
We have an AutoHotkey v2 macro for a Discord garden mini-game. The garden has two 10x10 plots separated by a 1x10 walkway. Start at the top of the walkway. Traversal: left plot serpentine top→bottom; each row enters from the walkway, harvests 10 tiles (long-press space ~1000ms for mutated fruit + Esc to dismiss, then 6-8 rapid taps ~160ms for normal fruit), sells (Shift+3), returns to garden (Shift+2), moves down 1, flips direction. After the left plot finishes, step right 1 to the walkway, run the right plot bottom→top with the same per-row sell/return, then step left 1 to the top walkway and loop. Inventory fills after 1 row so sell every row (rowsPerSell=1). Inputs use held keys: SendMode=Event, scancodes on, hold space/move ~160–220ms, pause between strokes ~250ms, modifier chords use chordPreGap ~30ms then holdMsChord ~350ms. Anti-detection: ±30ms jitter on all sleeps, 8% chance of a random micro-pause (400-1200ms) between rows. Crash recovery: after each row, a calibrated pixel color is checked (PixelGetColor with tolerance ±30 per channel, coords stored as Discord-window-relative offsets); if the color misses, the script hovers the voice channel, clicks the "Join Activity" button, waits ~8s for the activity to reload, presses Shift+2 to re-enter the garden, and restarts the cycle — up to 3 retries before aborting. Calibration (Shift+C) is a guided 3-step flow: pick a game-only pixel, voice-channel hover position, and button position; saved to garden_calibration.ini. Hotkeys: Shift+S start, Shift+P pause/resume, Shift+C calibrate, Ctrl+Esc abort. If inputs are ignored, try SendMode InputThenPlay or Play. Focus is Discord (auto-activated at start); assumes My Garden (Shift+2) returns you to the same tile you left from.

## Files
- `ahk (windows)/garden.ahk` — main macro with held inputs, per-row sell/return serpentine traversal for both plots, pause/resume, anti-detection jitter, progress tracking, and automatic crash recovery.
- `ahk (windows)/garden_calibration.ini` — auto-generated by Shift+C calibration; stores pixel + button coordinates for crash recovery. Not checked into git.
- `ahk (windows)/testScript.ahk` — input-method sweep tester (cycles SendEvent/Input/Play/InputThenPlay with scancodes).

## Tweaks
- Timing: `holdMsSpace`, `holdMsMove`, `holdMsChord`, `chordPreGap`, `pauseMs`, `tGarden`, `tShop`, `tAction`.
- Harvest: `harvestHoldMs` (mutated long-press), `harvestTapsMin`/`harvestTapsMax` (normal fruit tap count).
- Batch selling: `rowsPerSell` (rows harvested before selling; 1 = every row, increase if inventory allows).
- Anti-detection: `jitterMs` (±ms on all sleeps), `microPauseChance` / `microPauseMinMs` / `microPauseMaxMs`.
- Crash recovery: `crashCheckEnabled` (master toggle), `crashPixelTolerance` (color match tolerance, 0-255), `activityLoadDelay` (ms to wait after clicking Join Activity), `maxRecoveryRetries` (attempts before aborting).
- Input compatibility: `sendModeName` and `useScanCodes` (default scancodes + SendEvent). If Discord ignores input, try `InputThenPlay` or `Play`.

## How to run
1) Open Discord garden applet and focus it (or let the script auto-activate Discord).
2) Run `garden.ahk`.
3) **First time only**: press Shift+C to calibrate crash recovery — follow the 3-step tooltip prompts (game pixel, voice-channel hover, Join Activity button). Saved to `garden_calibration.ini`; only needs to be repeated if you move/resize Discord.
4) Press Shift+S to start, Shift+P to pause/resume, Ctrl+Esc to abort.
5) Start from the top of the walkway for correct alignment.
6) Adjust hold/pause timings if movement or chords miss.
